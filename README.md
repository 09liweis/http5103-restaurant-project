# Github Instruction
I encourage you guys to use GitHub as our repository to manage our code.

To use GitHub, you need to have a GitHub account, just register one and it will be very helpful for your future career

For Mac user, just use terminal
For windows user, you might need to download GitHub client

The following instruction is for command line usage:

git clone [repository]
cd [repository]

//add branch name for your development
git checkout -b [yourbranchname]

//after edit your file, add file, delete file
//add change
git add .

//add a message for this change
git commit -am “[message]”

//push to github repository
//git push -u origin [yourbranchname]

//send pull request on GitHub repository, you need to go online to finish this step

if you want to get the latest code from repository
git checkout master
git pull origin master
git checkout [yourbranch]
git merge master

if there is some conflict, fixed it
